# COFFEE SURVEY ANALYSIS (Work IN PROGRESS: this project is still being developed and improved)
This project analyzes an international coffee consumption survey using Pyhton, Pandas and MatPlotLib
The goal is to demostrate data cleaning, transformation and exploratory data analysis

Original CVS source: public major coffee survey from James Hoffmann, "Great American Taste Test"
Type:  56 questions answered by 4,042 participants, survey data with mixed data types, multi-value, categorical, ranges-based purposes ...
Dataset used for educational purposes.

## HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
GoogleColab: Open the notebook and run all the cells

## DATA PROCESSING
-Standardization of diferents types of values
-Cleaning and normalization of range-based responses (age, cups, spending...)
-Creation of min and max numeric representations (for further data analysis )

## ANALYSIS HIGHTLIGHTS
-Percentage of coffee consumers by age group
-Number of consumers grouped and counted by additives(sugar, milk, syrup, etc) and by age group
-Sweetener usage by age group (and by educational level)
-Hight-consumption consumer profiles
-Spending behavior

## TOOLS:
-Python
-Pandas
-MatPlotLib

## STRUCTURE:
'data/raw' : original csv file
'data/processed': cleaned datasets
'src': python data cleaning functions
'notebooks' : exploratory analysis and pie chart and bar charts visualizations using functions
